Differerential operators are the backbone of physic, they are used to describe the behavior of physical systems through differential equations. Thus while looking for a solution to those equation we formally inverse thes operatgor to get the solution, and we might leave the class of differezntiql operators to enter the class of pseudo-differential operators. Those will be the subject of those notes. 
Let's consider a different example, the Laplace equation on $\mathbb{R}$. The Laplace equation is given by
$$
(\Delta + I) u = 0
$$
where $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator, $I$ is the identity operator, and $u$ is a function of $x$ and $y$. The solution to this equation is given by
$$
u(x,y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} G(x-x', y-y') f(x', y') dx' dy'
$$
where $G(x,y)$ is the Green's function for the Laplace equation and $f(x,y)$ is the source term. 
In this case, the Laplace equation is represented by the differential operator $\Delta + I$, and the solution $u$ is obtained by integrating the product of the Green's function and the source term. This example illustrates the use of the Laplace operator plus the identity operator in solving partial differential equations.
To derive the solution to the Laplace equation using Fourier transform, we can start by applying the Fourier transform to both sides of the equation $(\Delta + I)u = 0$. The Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$ is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(x)](k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i k x} dx
$$

Applying the Fourier transform to the Laplace operator $\Delta$, we have:

$$
\mathcal{F}[\Delta u](k) = -4\pi^2 k^2 \mathcal{F}[u](k)
$$

Similarly, the Fourier transform of the identity operator $I$ is simply the function itself:

$$
\mathcal{F}[u](k) = \mathcal{F}[u](k)
$$

Substituting these results back into the original equation, we get:

$$
-4\pi^2 k^2 \mathcal{F}[u](k) + \mathcal{F}[u](k) = 0
$$

Simplifying the equation, we obtain:

$$
(1 - 4\pi^2 k^2) \mathcal{F}[u](k) = 0
$$

To find the solution $u(x,y)$, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of $\mathcal{F}[u](k)$. Since the equation $(1 - 4\pi^2 k^2) \mathcal{F}[u](k) = 0$ holds for all values of $k$, we can conclude that $\mathcal{F}[u](k)$ must be zero for all $k$ except at $k = \pm \frac{1}{2\pi}$.

Therefore, the solution to the Laplace equation is given by:

$$
u(x,y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} G(x-x', y-y') f(x', y') dx' dy'
$$

where $G(x,y)$ is the Green's function for the Laplace equation and $f(x,y)$ is the source term. The Green's function can be obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform of $\mathcal{F}[u](k)$ evaluated at $k = \pm \frac{1}{2\pi}$.

This derivation shows how the Fourier transform can be used to solve the Laplace equation and obtain the solution $u(x,y)$ in terms of the Green's function and the source term. It also highlights the connection between Fourier analysis and the study of partial differential equations.

Studying these kinds of operators will give us access to existence and uniqueness results for the solutions of equations, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Such constructions are also a nice way to introduce symplectic geometry and its link to Fourier analysis.
